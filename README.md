# awesome-distro
debian style distro watching

README TEXT:

Instructions (short version):

1. Start App
2. Configure URL of Distro on Configure page
3. Confirm URL Change and Click Pink 'go' button
4. Browse Repository ('BROWSE' button on main page)
5. Click on files for tracking (checkbox will turn green when file is selected)
6. LATER: click on 'CONFIGURE' and 'CHECK DISTRO' to see if updates for your files are available.

NOTES: The program just keeps one list of files for tracking, so if you switch the url you may still get notification that your package is new even though you selected it when another url was being used.

CHECK DISTRO typically will not work immediately after URL is set. It will take some time for the distro developers to update the package repository. Then the 'CHECK DISTRO' button will work. Be patient.
